	API nodecg for GV:

			- Get id graphic in request for load the corresponding html template.
		- Test the api
	Mapping card:
		- Define a structure for the mapping card in JSON.
		- Put it somewhere. (for the moment in my project but in the future in NFS)
		- Fill it with the data provide by Jenny.
		- Try convict module to know if it can validate data. If true, implement a function for validation.
		- Write unit testing for the validation function with jest module.
		
	Mapping html:

		- Implement a function for mapping.
		- For testing, write html templates and put them somewhere (for the moment in my project but in the future in NFS)
		- Write unit testing for the mapping function with jest module.
